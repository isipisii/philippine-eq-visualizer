This application is a visualization tool that displays real-time earthquake data from the USGS API. It is built using React and allows users to view earthquake data on a map, as well as toggle between different features. Visit [Here.](https://philippine-eq-visualizer.vercel.app/)

**Features**

`Map View`: Displays the earthquakes on a map, with each earthquake marked by a circle. The size of the circle represents the magnitude of the earthquake.

`Magnitude Chart`: Provides a chart that displays the magnitude of each earthquake as a line chart. This feature allows users to quickly see the heighest recorded magnitude of earthquake and the lower ones within the last 30 days.

`Pulse Toggler`: This feature allows users to toggle the pulse effect on the earthquake circles. When enabled, the circles will pulse to make them more visible.

`Automatic Flying`: This feature allows users to automatically fly to the location of an earthquake by clicking on the earthquake circle and earthquake details shown in the left side. The map will then zoom in on the location of the earthquake and display more detailed information about it.
